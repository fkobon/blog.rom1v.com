    Salute,

    Tu t'en sers pour faire quoi ? Quels sont les cas d'usage ?

    Merci, Tcho !

    @Cascador :

    I cross-post my answer (in English):

    Salute,

    Tu comptes publier un article en Français ? Je l'aurai bien remonté sur le
    Journal du hacker. Pour envoyer des SMS c'est très simple/pratique ou il
    faut avoir envie et faire des efforts selon toi ?

    Thanks ha ha, Tcho !

    J'avais hésité, mais finalement je ne vais pas publier en français: ça
    demande trop de travail d'écrire les articles en double.

    Je ne suis pas sûr d'avoir compris ta question sur les SMS. Moi, je
    trouve plus pratique de les écrire avec le clavier du PC.

    Could you make it run on older android versions like 4.3? Also can you
    please share your app on f-droid too?

    @cascador : utilises plutôt kconnect pour récupérer les sms vers ton ordi.
    Tu peux même faire du cross ^C^V !

    A great project！About one year ago, I just made a demo app to take a
    screenshot dynamically. However,the result you achieved is what I actually
    want.

    Thanks for writing and publishing scrcpy. It was easy to install via AUR on
    my Arch-based desktop and it works perfectly. Much appreciated!

    This looks amazing!  I tried it on Windows with my V20 and the image
    displays immediately and updates quick but it does not respond to my clicks.
    :(

    @jg, it seems that [clicks do not work with LG devices][issue18] on this
    version.

    Thanks for the app. Looks good and fast, but I can't get edge-swiping to
    work, which limits usability quite a bit. Likewise no pinch-zoom. Hope to
    see these in a future iteration.

    @Louie, I don't know if it's specific to Windows 10 but the first time I
    started the app it appeared not to work either. In my case the debugging
    mode trust dialog appeared on my phone but nothing happened after allowing
    the connection. Executing the app again worked but it spawned a duplicate
    process on my computer (CTRL+ALT+DEL -> Task Manager -- didn't know which
    one was the good one so I killed both). It appears to be working fine now.

    @Romain, nice work! Thanks for opening the source! I haven't checked the
    code yet but maybe there's an issue when connecting the phone in debugging
    mode for the first time on an untrusted computer?
