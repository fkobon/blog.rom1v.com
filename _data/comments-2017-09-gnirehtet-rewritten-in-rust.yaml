    > In C and C++, infinite loops without side-effects are undefined behavior.

    Actually, in C (unlike C++), such loops are only UB if the loop condition is
    not a constant expression.  However, LLVM fails to implement this exception
    as is thus breaking some correct C programs.  This has been reported against
    LLVM already more than ten years ago:

    Is the raw field in IPV4Header (and others) necessary? Are those accessed
    besides reading/writing the whole packet, including those headers?

    If not, why don't just use std::mem::transmute the convert the whole raw
    packet to/from the structs, right after reading / before writing the packet?
