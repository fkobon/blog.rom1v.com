    Actually, in C (unlike C++), such loops are only UB if the loop condition is
    not a constant expression.  However, LLVM fails to implement this exception
    as is thus breaking some correct C programs.  This has been reported against
    LLVM already more than ten years ago:
    <https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=965>.
